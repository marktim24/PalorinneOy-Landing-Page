# PalorinneOy Landing Page

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Palorinne OY Landing Page! This project showcases a fully responsive, professionally designed landing page.

You can access the live version of the landing page [here](https://marktim24.github.io/PalorinneOy-Landing-Page/).

## 🚀 Features

The landing page includes the following sections:

- **Home:** A welcoming introduction to the site.
- **About:** Information about the company and its services.
- **Services:** A detailed breakdown of services offered.
- **Contact:** A section for users to reach out for more information.

## 💻 Technology Stack

The landing page is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor which lets us use features that aren't available in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and others. Used extensively for styling the page, including child selectors, loops, pseudo-elements, media queries, functions, variables, and keyframes.
- JQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Used for creating animations and managing events on the page.
- Bootstrap: The world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, used for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Figma: Used for designing the layout and user interface of the landing page.
